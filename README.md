# lazyfivem
A simple CUI for running any FiveM server and executing commands.

## Install

### Windows (scoop)
```
# Add the extras bucket
scoop bucket add extras

# Install lazyfivem
scoop install lazyfivem
```

### Adding servers
Create a folder called `.lazyfivem` and a file inside called `config.yaml` at the very root of your computer.
Example:
```
mkdir C:/.lazyfivem
# Then create config.yaml inside
```

You can then add servers to `config.yaml` like this
```yml
NPWDServer: "X:/ServerFX/starter.bat"
QBCore Server: "X:/qbcoreServer/starter.bat"
```


## Mappings
* **TAB** - Moves cursor between the sidebar and command exec view
* **ENTER** - Starts the selected when you're in the sidebar view, and executes the command when you're in the command exec view.
