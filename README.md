# lazyfivem - WIP
A simple CUI for running any FiveM server and executing commands.

## Install
Download/clone the repo, and inside `cmd/lazyfivem`, run `go install .`. It will install `lazyfivem` to the PATH, 
and you can run `lazyfivem` in any terminal.

## Mappings
* **TAB** - Moves cursor between the sidebar and command exec view
* **ENTER** - Starts the selected when you're in the sidebar view, and executes the command when you're in the command exec view.
